# cross-platform-streaming

The following guide is very much the result of trial and error. It is not intended to be a definitive guide. It is a collection of notes to help you achieve a similar result to what I have achieved. Good luck!

The hardware I am using is as follows:
 - Mac Mini M1 2020
 -  Elgato Wave:3
 -  Standard PC speakers using the headphone jack of the Mac. They have a headphone out port also.

The software I am using is as follows:
 - MacOS Ventura 13.4 (22F66)
 - Google Chrome - for nostrnests.com
 - Safari - for YouTube Music
 - Android Studio - Giraffe | 2022.3.1 Patch 1 - https://developer.android.com/studio/
 - Android Virtual Device Manager
 - Loopback2 Version 2.2.13 from Rogue Amoeba - https://rogueamoeba.com/loopback/
 - BlackHole Virtual Audio Driver - https://github.com/ExistentialAudio/BlackHole

What I did


Important notes
